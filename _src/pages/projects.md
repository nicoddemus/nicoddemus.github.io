Title: Projects

This is a list of personal open-source projects, most (all?) of them hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/nicoddemus).

Below is a simple description on each one, please refer to the project homepage of each one you would like more details.

# [ss](https://github.com/nicoddemus/ss) #

Automatically finds subtitles for multiple movies using OpenSubtitle.org APIs. It can search recursively for videos in
directories, making it easy to download subtitles for TV show packs.

Makes use of the excellent [guessit](https://github.com/wackou/guessit) package.


# [pytest-qt](https://github.com/nicoddemus/pytest-qt) #

pytest-qt is a [pytest](pytest.org) plugin that provides fixtures to help write tests for PySide and PyQt applications.


# [cit](https://github.com/nicoddemus/cit) #

Command line tool to make a feature branch workflow easier with Jenkins.

This tool handles the aspect of creating and deleting jobs for feature branches in a Jenkins server, but has
evolved to also manipulate jobs on the server in a general way.

Awesome people at [ESSS](www.esss.com.br) [contributed](https://github.com/nicoddemus/cit/graphs/contributors) a lot to
it since its inception.


# [todo-dashboard](https://github.com/nicoddemus/todo-dashboard) #

Site that periodically scans repositories looking for *to-do* marks in the code in order to display them. I wrote that
because I wanted to work on [heroku](heroku.com) and because I felt we needed a way to keep track of our to-do tasks
in the code base.

This is still a work in progress at the moment.
