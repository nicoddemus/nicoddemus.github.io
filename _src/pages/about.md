Hi, my name is Bruno Oliveira. This is a blog for me to talk about programming in general, share cool libraries I've discovered
and projects I am working on.

I've been a programmer for over 16+ years and working professionally for over 12+ years, most of them at
[ESSS](http://www.esss.com.br).

My day-to-day work involves mostly desktop application development in Python and C++, but my personal interests
include DevOps, web applications, cloud computing and other development languages.

Thanks for reading!
