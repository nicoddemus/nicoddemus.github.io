Hi, my name is Bruno Oliveira. This is a blog for me to talk about programming in general, share cool libraries I've discovered
and projects I am working on.

I've been a programmer for over 18+ years and working professionally for over 14+ years, most of them at
[ESSS](http://www.esss.com.br).

My day-to-day work involves mostly desktop application development in Python and C++, but my personal interests
include DevOps, web applications, cloud computing and other development languages.

I'm one of [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) core maintainers and author of several plugins, including
[pytest-mock](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock), [pytest-qt](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-qt) 
and [pytest-faulthandler](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler).
