Summary: Moving the blog from Jekyll to Pelican

I have moved from [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com) as bloggin framework.
I made the change because while I like Jekyll's style and configuration, it is written in Ruby and I didn't feel like
learning the language just to customize the blog if I have to (if I learn Ruby, I rather it would be for cooler things).

Between the static generators available written in Python, Pelican seemed the best fit: mature, simple to configure and
easy to customize.

Liking it so far. :)
